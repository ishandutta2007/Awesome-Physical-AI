# 🤖 Awesome Physical AI

Physical AI (or Embodied AI) integrates AI models with physical hardware, such as robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles, allowing them to perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Below are the top open-source and closed-source frameworks/platforms for physical AI in 2025.

## 🌟 Top Open-Source Frameworks & Platforms

Open-source tools are primarily driven by the robotics community, offering transparency and high customization for research and development.

1.  **LeRobot (Hugging Face)**: A popular framework for real-world robotics, designed to make it easy to train, simulate, and deploy policies on low-cost robot arms and mobile robots.
