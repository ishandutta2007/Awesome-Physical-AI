# Awesome-Physical-AI
Physical AI (or Embodied AI) integrates AI models with physical hardware, such as robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles, allowing them to perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Below are the top open-source and closed-source frameworks/platforms for physical AI in 2025. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Top Open-Source Frameworks & Platforms 
Open-source tools are primarily driven by the robotics community, offering transparency and high customization for research and development. 

1. LeRobot (Hugging Face): A popular framework for real-world robotics, designed to make it easy to train, simulate, and deploy policies on low-cost robot arms and mobile robots. 

	• GitHub:  

2. ROS 2 (Robot Operating System): The industry standard middleware for robotics, acting as the backbone for connecting AI models to sensor data and actuator commands. 

	• GitHub:  

3. Physical-Intelligence/openpi: Open-source models and packages (π₀) for vision-language-action (VLA) manipulation, allowing robots to understand and execute tasks. 

	• GitHub:  

4. Isaac Lab (NVIDIA): A modular, open-source framework for robot learning (reinforcement and imitation learning) built on Isaac Sim for massive parallelism. 

	• GitHub:  

5. MuJoCo: A high-performance, open-source physics engine for robotics simulation, widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) research. 

	• GitHub:  

6. ALOHA (Actuation for Low-cost High-performance Agents): A low-cost, bimanual teleoperation system used to collect demonstrations for imitation learning. 

	• GitHub:  (Action Chunking with Transformers) 

7. Autoware: A comprehensive open-source software stack for self-driving vehicles, providing perception, planning, and control. 

	• GitHub:  [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  

Top Closed-Source Platforms 
Closed-source platforms offer specialized, high-performance, and integrated solutions, often with extensive support for industrial-grade hardware. 

1. NVIDIA Isaac / GR00T: A comprehensive AI platform for robotics, including simulators (Isaac Sim) and foundation models for humanoids (GR00T). It is the premier platform for high-fidelity simulation and synthetic data. 

	• Platform: NVIDIA Omniverse / Isaac Sim 

2. Boston Dynamics Spot SDK: A closed-source SDK for controlling the Spot quadruped robot, allowing integration of custom AI behaviors for navigation and inspection. 

	• Platform: Boston Dynamics 

3. Figure Humanoid AI (Helix): A closed-source VLA model developed by Figure for general-purpose humanoid robot control. 

	• Platform: Figure 

4. Covariant Brain: A platform focused on robotic manipulation, particularly in logistics, enabling AI to pick, sort, and move items. 

	• Platform: Covariant 

5. Wayve: A closed-source, end-to-end AI platform for autonomous driving, focusing on "embodied AI" that learns from real-world driving data. 

	• Platform: Wayve [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
